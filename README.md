I was intrigued going through this amazing article on building a multi-label image classification model last week. The data scientist enthusiast in me started exploring possibilities of transforming this idea into a Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem.

Most of the NLP tutorials are dealing with idea of single-label classification challenges. But community forum posts are not one-dimensional. One post can span several tags. 

#### For example: 

##### Post: How to do webscraping using python and Selenium? 
##### Tags: webscraping, python, selenium.

In the above scenerio, three tags are used for classification. Now THAT is a challenge, I would love to take up and embrace as a data scientist enthusiast. 

#### I extracted a bunch of tags and topics from Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow and got down to work using this concept of multi-label classification. 

And the results, even using a simple model, are truly impressive.

### F1 Score- 0.45 , Accuracy is 0.96 for my scraped dataset.
